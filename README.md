Chemical (Retro)Synthesis on Cardano

## Project Catalyst (Use Cases: Concept)
We’re submitting **On-Chain Verifiable Chemistry** (₳100k) as a proto-infrastructure MVP for Cardano:
- Type-safe Haskell molecular representation, thanks to O.J. Goldstein's (https://github.com/oliverjgoldstein) insight on the failings of both SMILES & SELFIES
- Plutus validators for (retro)synthesis step verification - still a work in progress, but check out what we managed to create last year for ETH Global SF - https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chimiadao-xsmjg 
- Demo UI + docs - still a work in progress, anyone who is transparent and knows they are aligned with any of the above, please do get in touch!
